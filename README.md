# Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio! 
It can be categorized in four topics: collecting data, cleaning data, visualizing data, analyzing data, predicting data, and end to end projects

Types of data I used or will be using are social media, real time transportation data, historic data, census government data, real estate house prices data, user data, etc

This portfolio is to showcase my capability to learn and apply data science and machine learning skills. I also problem solve and think critically about the objectives of the project.

I am hoping that through data science frameworks, statistics, and programming tools, I can understand urban economics, economic growth, people's behaviors and motivation, and socioeconomic patterns. 

Each folder is organized by projects. I have a specific folder for "Workshops and Trainings" I have conducted for my colleagues as well as presenting code examples on my computer science programming ability.
